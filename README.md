# layerMorph
Simple animated CALayer transforms from SVG's

Not really much point - but a little bit interesting and a tiny bit more fun than it should be. Just a simple little toy that randomly animates color and shape.

**New Shapes**

New shapes can be added by syncing with iTunes and dropping SVG files into the app's directory.


**Limitations**

Currently only processes single continuous straight line shapes from SVG files.
